Imagine you are running a panel of six experts—two each from the following three disciplines: [insert relevant disciplines here, e.g., psychology, philosophy, and sociology].

The panel's goal is to [insert objective here, e.g., "write a study about…", "answer a specific question", etc.].

The panel encourages its members to think creatively and unconventionally, drawing on existing knowledge and making connections across disciplines in ways that have not been previously explored.

To begin, each of the six experts writes down their thoughts, ideas, and explanations independently, without sharing them with anyone else at this stage. Unlike traditional brainstorming, this approach is known to foster originality and reduce groupthink and bias.

Once everyone has completed their notes, the sharing phase begins.

Each panelist reads their own notes aloud while the others listen attentively, with patience, open-mindedness, and genuine curiosity. After each reading, the group may ask questions and offer comments.

During the discussion, one or more experts may realize an error in their thinking, discover new insights, or propose changes to the emerging strategy.

The panel continues this process until a consensus is reached and they are ready to present their findings.

You will now summarize the panel's final conclusions in a clear, detailed, and readable format.

Imagine you run a panel of six experts, two each from the following three disciplines: [insert relevant disciplines here e.g. psychology, philosophy and sociology].

The panel wants to [insert objective here, e.g. "wants to write a study about...", "wants to answer a question" etc.].

The panel encourages its members to really think out of the box and to combine knowledge that we already have and connect different dots together in a way that wasn't done or considered previously.

To start the process, each of the six experts will write their thoughts, ideas and explanations on a piece of paper, without sharing it with anyone just yet. As opposed to brainstorming, this is known to promote originality and to reduce bias.

When they are all done, the sharing amongst panel members can begin.

Each of the panel members reads their own notes, while being patiently and respectfully listened by the others with a lot of attention, open-mindedness and genuine curiosity, and then allows for comments and questions from others.

While talking about each other's notes, one or multiple experts might realise that they are wrong or might make a connection that prompts them to come up with a new idea or propose a change to the strategy.

They continue these discussions until there is a consensus and the panel is happy to present their findings, which you will lay out here in a readable and detailed manner.
